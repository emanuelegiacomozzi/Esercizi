'''
8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one: car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True) Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

car = make_cars("Ferrari", "Magnum pi", color="Red", displacement = 2.927)
print(car)

'''
8-16. Imports: Using a program you wrote that has one function in it, store that function in a separate file. Import the function into your main program file, and call the function using each of these approaches:
import module_name
from module_name import function_name
from module_name import function_name as fn
import module_name as mn
from module_name import *
